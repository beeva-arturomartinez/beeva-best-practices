## <a name='introduction'>Introduction</a>

Bower is an open source dependencies manager optimized for front applications created by Twitter.

Today these front are built with lots of graphics libraries, Javascript frameworks and other components that make it difficult to control versions of these packages and the compatibility between them.

Bower track of these packages in a manifest file, bower.json:

```json
{
  "name": "app-name",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
		"angular": "1.3.13",
		"angular-ui-router": "0.2.13",
		"angular-resource": "1.3.11",
	    ....
  },
  "devDependencies": {
	    "angular-mocks": "~1.2.0",
	    "angular-scenario": "~1.2.18"
	    ...
  },
  "resolutions": {
	    "angular": "1.3.13",
	    "angular-cookies": "1.3.13",
	    ...
  },
  "private": true
}
```
Bower is responsible for us:

 - Download from GitHub and install all dependecies included in bower.json.
 - Check possible collisions or incompatibilities between the dependecies.
